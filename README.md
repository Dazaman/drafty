# drafty

- Ideas for improvement over drapht
  - Have current gw teams displayed
  - Live draft board? Might be too late for that
  - Read directly from duckdb file instead of csv extracts from queries to duckdb (Experiment size + time efficiency)
  - Document on how to get league code + have refresh ETL process for multiple leagues ?
